This is a prototype game I am developing as part of an experimental project. The README file serves as a documentation and tracking tool for the systems and processes I am currently testing. The game is designed to explore and evaluate a highly optimized game environment using the Bevy engine with Rust, offering a departure from the Unity-based development workflows I have traditionally utilized.
